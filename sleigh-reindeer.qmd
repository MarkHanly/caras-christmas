As Cara descended from the starry sky she spotted Santa's sleigh lay nestled among the snow-covered trees of the night-time forest. The once-majestic sleigh, adorned with festive lights and laden with presents, was buried deep in tangle of briars.

Cara padded towards the sleigh with Jingleberry still sitting on her back. Santa greeted them with a hearty "Ho, ho, ho! My dear friends, it seems I've hit a bit of a hiccup in my journey. The sleigh's harness got tangled in some flying gingerbread. I could use a bit of help to get everything back in order."

"Fear not, Santa! We're here to lend a hand" said Jingleberry!

Using her antlers, Cara carefully untangled the sleigh from the briars. Jingleberry ran back and forth gathering the fallen presents from the snow, his bells jingling all the way. 

"Oh oh oh! Thank you both!" cried Santa in delight. But what are we to do, the reindeer took fright and ran away to the night-time forest. 

Jingleberry looked at Cara and Cara looked back at Jingleberry. They both shared a festive smile. 

With Santa's help, Jingleberry quickly harnessed Cara to the sleigh. Soon they were ready to take to the skies on the most magical journey of the year.
