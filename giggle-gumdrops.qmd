Cara couldn't resist the charm of the Giggle Gumdrops, and with a cheerful nod, she tried a handful. As soon as she tasted the magical treats, her giggles echoed through the market, and she began to float in the air, surrounded by a group of flying gingerbread cookies.

Giggling and floating, Cara reached the end of the market where she saw two intriguing paths.

In front of her, a candy cane bridge led to a mysterious forest. To her left, a jingle bell path twinkled with festive lights.
