To her right, a colorful tent with a sign that read “Madame Mistletoe’s Magical Fortunes” caught Cara’s eye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\n  The candy cane bridge\n    \n\n\nThe jingle bell path\n\n\n\nThe fortune teller"

The air was filled with the sweet scent of peppermint and magic.\nJust as Cara set foot on the candy-cane bridge, she heard a tiny voice nearby. Turning around, she discovered a mischievous Christmas elf named Jingleberry. With a twinkle in his eye and a hat adorned with jingling bells, Jingleberry looked like he was up to something exciting.\n“Hello there, Cara!” Jingleberry exclaimed, doing a little jig. “I’m Jingleberry, the elf of festive fun! I need your help with something important.”\nCara looked at Jingleberry, her eyes wide with curiosity. “What can I do to help, Jingleberry?”\nJingleberry explained that he had gotten lost in the snow and couldn’t find his way back to Santa’s workshop. He had even lost his knapsack and had no supper!\nJust then, Jingleberry’s tummy started to rumble with hunger. Poor little elf! thought Cara.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nShare the last giggle gumdrops\n\n\n\nHelp Jingleberry hunt for his knapsack\n\n\n\nSearch for Santa's workshop"

The candy-cane bridge beneath them started to shimmer, and suddenly, they were lifted into the air, soaring over the Christmas forest.\nAs they giggled and floated through the sky, they spotted Santa’s sleigh nestled among the tall evergreen trees. Santa’s reindeer were grazing on magical snowflakes, and Santa himself was checking his list with a twinkle in his eye.\nNext, they flew over Santa’s workshop, where cheerful elves were busy wrapping presents and preparing for the big night. The lights twinkled like a million stars, and the sound of holiday cheer filled the air.\nBut there was something else catching their attention. In a clearing below, they saw a group of playful snowmen having a snowball fight. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nSanta's sleigh\n\n\n\nSanta's workshop\n\n\n\nThe snowmen"

As Cara and Jingleberry approached they could hear the rhythmic sound of hammers and cheerful singing.\nHome at last! cried Jingleberry happily. But his smile did not last long.\nAt the entrance of the workshop, they were welcomed by Mrs. Claus, who wore a worried expression. “Oh, hello dears! Have you seen Santa by any chance? It’s Christmas eve and he’s nowhere to be found, I’m starting to get a little worried.”\nCara and Jingleberry exchanged concerned glances. There were no more giggle gumdrops left, they would have to return to the night-time forest on foot.\nWe could always take my jinglebike!? suggested Jingleberry, pointing towards a little red bicycle with a sturdy frame and candycane handlebars.\nOr… said Mrs Claus thoughtfully looking towards the lamplit barn, there’s always Tipsycake?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nGo back on foot\n\n\n\nTake the jinglebike\n\n\n\nGo to the barn"

    "text": "Normally I’d let you take a reindeer, explained Mrs Claus as she led Cara and Jingleberry to the barn. But they are all getting ready for the big run tonight. I’m sure Tipsycake will help you find Santa.\nAs they entered, they were greeted by the warm glow of a turf fire. In the midst of this cozy atmosphere, Cara’s eyes widened with wonder as she spotted a majestic unicorn resting calmly on a bed of ribbons and holly.\nTipsycake’s fur shimmered like freshly fallen snow and her mane sparkled with tinsel. Around her neck hung a Christmas wreath braided with lanterns and bells.\nSensing adventure in the air, the unicorn stood to her full fight and trotted out of the warm barn into the snow-filled yard. Don’t be naughty Jingleberry, pleaded Mrs Claus as she helped the elf onto Tipsycake’s back. And remember to be nice, she added, lifting Cara up as well.\nWith a gallop of hooves and a golden spark, Cara and Jingleberry once again ascended into the starry sky. Soon they were high above the night-time forest, scanning the trees below for the lights of Santa’s sleigh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate stall\n\n\n\nThe fortune teller\n\n\n\nThe stable"
