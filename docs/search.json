As she approached the tent she noticed a sign that read, “Madame Mistletoe’s Magical Fortunes.”\nIntrigued, Cara entered the tent, where the air was filled with the scent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Inside, she found a cozy space with cushions and draped fabrics. In the center sat Madame Mistletoe, a kindly elf with long red hair and twinkling green eyes.\n“Ah, welcome, dear child! I’ve been expecting you,” Madame Mistletoe said with smile.\nCara blinked in surprise. “You have? How did you know?”\nMadame Mistletoe chuckled softly. “I see things that others might not. Now, let us unveil the mysteries of your Christmas fortune.”\nCara eagerly sat across from Madame Mistletoe as she held the crystal bauble up to the light. It sparkled with a magical glow, revealing images and hints of the adventure that awaited.\n“The crystal shows me visions of giggles and gumdrops. Eat them with joy, and let the laughter guide your way,” Madame Mistletoe said, her voice filled with warmth.\n“But beware the snowmen, they are not always what they seem” added madame Mistletoe frostily.\nCara nodded, her excitement building. She thanked Madame Mistletoe and left the tent. Where to next? she thought, with a thrill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate stall\n\n\n\nThe candy cane bridge"

But what are we to do, the reindeer took fright and ran away to the night-time forest.\nJingleberry looked at Cara and Cara looked back at Jingleberry.
