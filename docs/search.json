As she approached the tent she noticed a sign that read, “Madame Mistletoe’s Magical Fortunes.”\nIntrigued, Cara entered the tent, where the air was filled with the scent of cinnamon and nutmeg. Inside, she found a cozy space with cushions and draped fabrics. In the center sat Madame Mistletoe, a kindly enchantress with long red hair and twinkling green eyes.\n“Ah, welcome, dear child! I’ve been expecting you,” Madame Mistletoe said with smile.\nCara blinked in surprise. “You have? How did you know?”\nMadame Mistletoe chuckled softly. “I see things that others might not. Now, let us unveil the mysteries of your Christmas fortune” she said, offering Cara a warm goblet full of mulled mistletoe wine.\nCara eagerly sat sipping the warming tonic while Madame Mistletoe gazed into her crystal bauble. The bauble sparkled with a magical glow, revealing flurried images of future adventures.\n“The crystal bauble shows me visions of new friends and starry skies” Madame Mistletoe said, her voice filled with warmth. “Let laughter and friendship guide your way”.\n“But beware the snowmen, they are not always what they seem” added madame Mistletoe frostily.\nCara nodded, her excitement building. She thanked Madame Mistletoe and left the candlelit tent.

Suddenly, the snowmen came to life, pelting her with snowballs. Cara giggled as she tried to dodge the frosty onslaught, but soon found herself surrounded.\nJust as she was about to be covered in a snowy blanket, a voice rang out, “Hold on there, frosty fellows! That’s no way to treat a friend.”\nCara turned to see a lively elf with a jingling hat and a satchel of jingle berries. It was Jingleberry, the cheerful guardian of the Jingle Bell Path.\nWith a swift wave of his jingling wand, Jingleberry cast a spell that made the snowmen break into laughter instead of launching snowballs. They danced and jingled around, transforming the icy battlefield into a winter wonderland of joy.\n“Phew, that was close! Thanks for saving me, Jingleberry,” Cara exclaimed, grateful for her new elf friend.\nJingleberry grinned, “No problem at all! Us elves stick together, especially during the most jingling time of the year.\n“Where will this path take me, Jingleberry?” asked Cara.\nWhy this is the way to Santa’s workshop, silly goose! teased Jingleberry.

The snowmen had their snowballs at the ready, and Cara could see they were slushy and icy cold.\n“Please, no!” cried the little elf with a terrified jingle.\nWith a determined gleam in her reindeer eyes, Cara galloped towards the snowmen. Shaking her antlers, she created a shield of swirling snow, blocking the incoming barrage and rescuing the elf from the snowy assault.\n“Oh thank you!” exclaimed the elf, “these snowmen are a menace”.\n“Quickly, hop on” said Cara, scooping the elf onto her back.\nThe mischievous snowmen watched in awe as Cara and Jingleberry flew away, leaving them behind in the powdery white snow.\n“I’m Jingleberry by the way” said the elf, clutching to Cara’s velvety antlers. “Thank you for saving me!” he continued, with a jingle and a smile. “Do you think you could drop me back to Santa’s workshop?”\nFeeling the Chocolate Reindeer magic begin to fade, Cara knew she would have to land soon. They flew over the night-time forest towards to glowing lights and far-off sounds of hammering and singing from Santa’s workshop.\nOh look! said Jingleberry, pointing excitedly. Far below, there was a beautiful wooden sleigh nestled among the tall evergreen trees. “I think that’s Santa’s sleigh” he jingled merrily. “But if that’s Santa’s sleigh, where are the reindeer?” wondered Cara.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo back\n\n\n\n  \nSanta's workshop\n\n\n\nSanta's sleigh"

Around her neck hung a Christmas wreath braided with lanterns and bells.\nSensing adventure in the air, the unicorn stood to her full height and trotted out of the warm stable into the snow-filled yard. “Don’t be naughty Jingleberry”, pleaded Mrs Claus as she helped the elf onto Tipsycake’s back. “And remember to be nice” she added, smiling, as she lifted Cara up behind the elf.\nWith a gallop of hooves and a golden spark, Tipsycake rose into the starry sky.

There are even some wild herds in the Antipodes, notably in the foothills of Cradle Mountain on the Island of Tasmania and the snowy slopes of Tierra del Fuego.\nAll of these branches were calved from the original herds found in the northern ranges of Lapland where they still number in their tens of thousands.\nLike all of Santa’s Christmas Unicorns, Tipsycake comes from this herd."
