## Lost in the night-time forest

Cara and Jingleberry walked for hours through the night-time forest. There was no sign of the lights from Santa's sleigh, just dark branches and the crunch of snow. 

Cara felt cold and tired and even Jingleberry had stopped jingling gaily by her side. 

Finally Cara sat down in the snow, exhausted. "I'm banjaxed" she cried "and we're lost!". Jingleberry jangled and knelt in the snow beside Cara. Using his cloak as a blanket, he wrapped it around Cara and she soon fell asleep. 

"We're lost, we're lost" tinkled Jingleberry sadly, shivering in the snow.

***

Cara awoke as a radiant glow emerged through the trees. There, against the starlit backdrop, appeared Santa Claus atop Tipsycake, his majestic Christmas unicorn.

Tipsycake was as white as freshly fallen snow, her mane was a glittering pink tinsel and her horn emitting an enchanting glow.  

"Ho ho ho!" bellowed Santa Claus, "I'm glad I've finally found you two! Come on, it's time we got you home."
