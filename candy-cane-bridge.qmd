Still giggling, Cara descended towards the candy-cane bridge. The air was filled with the sweet scent of peppermint and magic.

Just as Cara set foot on the candy-cane bridge, she heard a tiny voice nearby. Turning around, she discovered a mischievous Christmas elf named Jingleberry. With a twinkle in his eye and a hat adorned with jingling bells, Jingleberry looked like he was up to something exciting.

"Hello there, Cara!" Jingleberry exclaimed, doing a little jig. "I'm Jingleberry, the elf of festive fun! I need your help with something important."

Cara looked at Jingleberry, her eyes wide with curiosity. "What can I do to help, Jingleberry?"

Jingleberry explained that he had gotten lost in the snow and couldn't find his way back to Santa's workshop. He had even lost his knapsack and had no supper! 

Just then, Jingleberry's tummy started to rumble with hunger. Poor little elf! thought Cara.
