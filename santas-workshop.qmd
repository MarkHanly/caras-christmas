Santa's workshop was nestled in a clearing deep within the night-time forest. As Cara and Jingleberry approached they could hear the rhythmic sound of hammers and cheerful singing. 

Home at last! cried Jingleberry happily. But his smile did not last long.

At the entrance of the workshop, they were welcomed by Mrs. Claus, who wore a worried expression. "Oh, hello dears! Have you seen Santa by any chance? It's Christmas eve and he's nowhere to be found, I'm starting to get a little worried."

Cara and Jingleberry exchanged concerned glances. There were no more giggle gumdrops left, they would have to return to the night-time forest on foot. 

We could always take my jinglebike!? suggested Jingleberry, pointing towards a little red bicycle with a sturdy frame and candycane handlebars. 

Or... said Mrs Claus thoughtfully looking towards the lamplit barn, there's always Tipsycake?
