Drawn to the allure of the Chocolate Reindeer, Cara eagerly selected one. As she took a bite, a wave of enchantment coursed through her, and she felt the chocolate stall slowly start to spin.

Wizzle gazed in wonder as Cara's coat began to transform into a deer's tawny fur. A pair of majestic antler's sprouted from her forehead, her legs grew longer while her shoes and gloves transformed into black shiny hooves. 

Before the chocolate treat was finished, Cara stood eight feet tall, magically transformed into a majestic reindeer, complete with velvety antlers.

"Oh deer, oh deer, oh deer", muttered Wizzle, "this isn't supposed to happen!". 

Cara trotted lightly into the Christmas Market, enjoying the fresh feeling of snow under her hooves. 

"Come back!" called Wizzle, but Cara was too excited to hear. Gathering speed from a trot to a canter, Cara felt the rush of weightlessness beneath her and with a joyous leap she soared into the sky.

Flying high above the market Cara could see the whole night-time forest spread out below. In a clearing in the woods she saw a group of snowmen playfully throwing snowballs. Each snowball sparkled with a different color, creating a dazzling display of winter magic.

Cara suddenly noticed something strange flying up ahead. An elf sped through the air on a little red bicycle, leaving behind a trail of sparkles and jingling laughter.
